# Question 1
## 1.1
Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ be a random sample of size $n$ taken from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$.

a. Show that the sample mean $\bar{x}$ and $\frac{1}{2}(x_1 + x_2)$ are unbiased estimators of $\mu$.

b. Which one is more effective?


## 1.2

Let $X$ be a random variable with $\mathbb{E}(X) = \mu$ and $\text{Var}(X) = \sigma^2$.

We have information about four independent observations: $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$.
Let $\hat{\mu}_1 = \frac{1}{4}(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4)$ be an estimator for the population mean.
**Note: Cross covariances are zero because the observations are independent.**

a. Find $\mathbb{E}(\hat{\mu}_1)$ in terms of $\mu$.

b. Find $\text{Var}(\hat{\mu}_1)$ in terms of $\sigma^2$.

Now consider a second estimator for the population mean μ̂2 being defined as:

 $$\hat{\mu}_2 = \frac{1}{8}x_1 +  \frac{1}{8}x_2 +  \frac{1}{4}x_3 +  \frac{1}{2}x_4$$

Show that this second estimator is also an unbiased estimator for the population
mean. Find its variance.

c. Discuss the sufficiency of both estimators $\hat{\mu}_1$ and $\hat{\mu}_2$.

d. Based on all previous answers, determine which estimator is preferred and explain why.
