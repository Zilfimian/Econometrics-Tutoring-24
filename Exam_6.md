# Question 1

Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ be a random sample of size $n$ taken from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$.

## Show that the sample mean $\bar{x}$ and $\frac{1}{2}(x_1 + x_2)$ are unbiased estimators of $\mu$.
## Which one is more effective?


# Question 2

Suppose you are asked to conduct a study investigating the Effect of Remote Work on Productivity

a) Why might you expect a positive correlation between the ability to work remotely and employee productivity?

b) Would a positive correlation necessarily show that remote work causes higher productivity? Explain.
