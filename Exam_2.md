You are given data from a survey conducted in 2017 on 96 regions in a country. The survey provides the following information:

Poverty Rate (percentage of the population below the poverty line)
Unemployment Rate (percentage of the labor force that is unemployed)
Source: National Statistics Institute, 2017.
Poverty Rate=12.5+1.3Ã—Unemployment Rate

Question:
Q1: By how much does the poverty rate increase when the unemployment rate increases by 2 percentage points? Explain why some actual poverty rates might fall below the value predicted by the regression model.
Q2: Question: In a Simple Linear Regression Model (SLRM) of poverty rate on unemployment rate, which of the Gauss-Markov assumptions is very likely to be violated? Explain.
Q3: Question: Given the OLS regression, compute the residual for a region with an unemployment rate of 7% and a poverty rate of 22%.
