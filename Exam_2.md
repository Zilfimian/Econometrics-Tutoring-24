# Question 1

Let $\(Y_1\), \(Y_2\), and \(Y_3\)$ be a random sample from a normal distribution where both $\(\mu\)$ and $\(\sigma\)$ are unknown. Which of the following is an unbiased and a more efficient estimator for $\(\mu\)$? 

$\hat{\mu}_1 = \frac{1}{4} Y_1 + \frac{1}{2} Y_2 + \frac{1}{4} Y_3$

$\hat{\mu}_2 = \frac{1}{3} Y_1 + \frac{1}{3} Y_2 + \frac{1}{3} Y_3$

a. unbiased - ?
b. efficient - ?
