## Problem: Estimating the Population Mean with Different Observations

Let $Y$ be a random variable with $\mathbb{E}(Y) = \nu$ and $\text{Var}(Y) = \tau^2$.

We have information about five independent observations: $y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5$.
Let $\hat{\nu}_1 = \frac{1}{5}(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 + y_5)$ be an estimator for the population mean.
**Note: Cross covariances are zero because the observations are independent.**

a. Find $\mathbb{E}(\hat{\nu}_1)$ in terms of $\nu$.

b. Find $\text{Var}(\hat{\nu}_1)$ in terms of $\tau^2$.


Consider a second estimator for the population mean $\hat{\nu}_2$ defined as:

$$\hat{\nu}_2 = \frac{1}{10}y_1 + \frac{1}{10}y_2 + \frac{2}{10}y_3 + \frac{3}{10}y_4 + \frac{3}{10}y_5$$

c. Show that $\hat{\nu}_2$ is an unbiased estimator for the population mean $\nu$.

d. Find the variance of $\hat{\nu}_2$ in terms of $\tau^2$.

e. Discuss the sufficiency of both estimators $\hat{\nu}_1$ and $\hat{\nu}_2$.

f. Based on all previous answers, determine which estimator is preferred and explain why.

What is the purpose of using dummy variables in regression analysis?
- A) To represent categorical variables with more than two levels.
- B) To remove outliers from the dataset.
- C) To standardize the data before regression.
- D) To create interaction terms between independent variables.


When creating dummy variables for a categorical variable with  k levels, what is the reference category?
- A) The category with the highest frequency.
- B) The first category in alphabetical order.
- C) The category with the lowest frequency.
- D) Any category chosen by the analyst.

What is the interpretation of the coefficient associated with a dummy variable in regression analysis?
- A) The change in the dependent variable when the dummy variable equals 1 compared to the reference category.
- B) The change in the dependent variable when the dummy variable equals 0 compared to the reference category.
- C) The proportion of variance explained by the dummy variable.
- D) The significance level of the dummy variable in the model.
