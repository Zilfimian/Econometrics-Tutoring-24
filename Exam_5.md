# Question 1

Given independent random variables \(X_1, X_2, X_3\) with the following properties:

- $E[X_1] = 1, \text{Var}[X_1] = 4$
- $E[X_2] = 2,  \text{Var}[X_2] = 3$
- $E[X_3] = 3,  \text{Var}[X_3] = 5$

### Expectation of \(5X_1 + 2\)

### Expectation of $4X_1 + 2X_2 - 6X_3$

### Variance of $5X_1 + 2$

### Variance of $4X_1 + 2X_2 - 6X_3$

# Question 2
When conducting a regression analysis, how is the F-statistic calculated for the overall significance test?
- A) The ratio of explained variance to unexplained variance.
- B) The ratio of residual sum of squares to total sum of squares.
- C) The ratio of explained sum of squares to residual sum of squares.
- D) The ratio of total sum of squares to explained sum of squares.
