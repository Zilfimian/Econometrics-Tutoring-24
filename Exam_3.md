# Question 1

Let  Y  be a random variable such that:
$E(Y) = \nu = 2$
$\text{Var}(Y) = \theta^2 = 4$

We have information about three iid observations: $y_1, y_2, y_3$.

### Task a
Let $\nû_1$ and $\nû_2$ be two different estimators of $\mu$. Determine which one is more appropriate according to the mean square error (MSE).

$$\nû_1 = \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}$$

$$\nû_2 = \frac{y_2 + y_3}{4}$$

### Task b
Discuss the sufficiency of both estimators.

### Task c
Suggest a sufficient estimator of $\nu$ and with a MSE lower than the above ones.
