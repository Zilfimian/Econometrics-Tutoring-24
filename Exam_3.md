# Question 1

Let  Y  be a random variable such that:
$E(Y) = \nu = 2$
$\text{Var}(Y) = \theta^2 = 4$

We have information about three iid observations: $y_1, y_2, y_3$.

### Task a
Let $\nû_1$ and $\nû_2$ be two different estimators of $\mu$. Determine which one is more appropriate according to the mean square error (MSE).

$$\nû_1 = \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}$$

$$\nû_2 = \frac{y_2 + y_3}{4}$$

### Task b
Discuss the sufficiency of both estimators.

### Task c
Suggest a sufficient estimator of $\nu$ and with a MSE lower than the above ones.


# Question 2

2.1 What does the p-value associated with an independent variable in a regression model indicate?
- A) The sign of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
- B) The proportion of variance explained by the independent variable.
- C) The probability of observing the given coefficient value if the null hypothesis (no effect) is true.
- D) The significance level of the residuals in the model.

2.2 What is the purpose of the residual plot in regression analysis?
- A) To visualize the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
- B) To check for the presence of multicollinearity among independent variables.
- C) To assess the normality and homoscedasticity of residuals.
- D) To determine the significance level of the coefficients in the regression model.

  
2.3 What does a low p-value associated with the F-test in regression analysis indicate?
- A) The overall regression model is not significant.
- B) At least one of the independent variables is not significant.
- C) The intercept coefficient is significant.
- D) All independent variables are significant predictors of the dependent variable.

2.4 In a regression analysis, if the p-value associated with an independent variable's coefficient is less than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), what does this suggest?
- A) The independent variable is not a significant predictor of the dependent variable.
- B) The independent variable is a significant predictor of the dependent variable.
- C) The coefficient is equal to zero.
- D) The residuals are not normally distributed.

  2.5 In regression analysis, how many dummy variables are needed to represent a categorical variable with k levels?

- A) k
- B) k-1
- C) k+1
- D) 2k


# Question 3

Determine whether the following data correspond to time series or cross sectional data.

1. Yearly race distribution in the United States during the last 20 years
2. Average housing prices in New York City from 1990 to 2020
3. Current life expectancy in different countries as of 2021
4. Number of students enrolled in primary schools in different regions of India in 2022
5. Monthly water consumption during the 20th century in the city of Madrid
6. R&D expenditure in each of the European Union member states in 2003

# Question 4

Studying the Impact of Exercise on Mental Health

a) Why might you expect a positive correlation between regular exercise and improved mental health?

b) Would a positive correlation necessarily show that regular exercise causes improved mental health? Explain.

# Question 5

A manager wants to know how employees feel about the new office policies. The manager asks the first 5 employees who arrive at work on Monday to give their opinions. The manager concludes from their responses that employees are generally satisfied with the new policies.

a) What is the sample? What is the population?

b) Could you identify any problems with choosing the sample in this way?

# Question 6

We have a sample of 45 students enrolled in a course. We ask each student to report the number of hours they study per week from 0 to 10. We also know, for each student, their exam score (y) out of 100. A linear regression line is estimated such that

$$\hat{y}_i = 30 + 5x_i$$

$$(1.2) \quad (0.5)$$

$$R^2 = 0.42$$

a- Interpret the estimated regression model and the value of the R-squared  
b- Test the null hypothesis that study hours per week do not produce any significant effect on exam scores at a 1% significance level.  
c- A different student studies 8 hours per week. Find the predicted exam score for this student.  
d- In your opinion, explain one application of the above model from the perspective of the Academic Support department of the university.
